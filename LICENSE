 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.
 By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software
 and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other free software
 programs are released under the GNU Lesser General Public License.) You can apply it to
 your programs, too.

 When a program is under this license, you have the freedom to run it, study and change it,
 and redistribute copies of either the original or your modified version. You may do so
 either commercially or noncommercially.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

                        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed
 by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General
 Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work"
 means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

   Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this
 License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and
 the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
 Program (independent of the use of the Program).

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
 it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy
 an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices
 that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients
 of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option
 offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a
 work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
 of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed
 the files and the date of any change.

      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains
 or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
 to all third parties under the terms of this License.

  Thus, the recipients of a modified work automatically receive a license from the original
 author to use, modify and distribute that work, even though that work is not originally
 licensed under the terms of the General Public License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object
 code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above, provided that you also
 do one of the following:

      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must
 be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
 software interchange; or,

      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party
, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing this conveying of source,
 a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under
 the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding
 source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
 received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
 Subsection b above.)

  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided
 under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
 is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
 have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
 so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else
 grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions
 are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing
 the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
 so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works
 based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically
 receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
 terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
 rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other
 reason, conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that you must
 not distribute the Program in some or all of its parts, then as a consequence you may not distribute
 the Program at all.

  8. If the distribution of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by law or by
 voluntary decision of the copyright holder, you must restrict the distribution of the Program in those
 countries and include this License file along with the Program.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public
 License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
 differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  It is your responsibility to check this License for any modifications between versions.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions
 are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software that is copyrighted by others than
 the authors of the Program, write to the copyright holder to ask for permission.

                    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
 PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
 PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
 BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you. Should the program prove
 defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,
 OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
 USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
 INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE).
